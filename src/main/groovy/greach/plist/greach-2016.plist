			<string>A Groovy Journey in Open Source</string>
			<key>sessionDescription</key>
			<string><![CDATA[In dog years… err… Open Source years, the Groovy programming language project is a very mature and successful one, as its 4.5 million downloads a year can attest. The Groovy language is certainly the most widely deployed alternative language of the JVM today. But how do we go from a hobby night &#038; week-end project to professionally company sponsored? And back again to hobby mode but joining the wider Apache Software Foundation community?
Guillaume will guide you through the history of the project, its latest developments, and its recent news, outlining the importance of a community around an Open Source project.
Also, we’ll discuss what it means to contribute, when it’s your hobby or as a paid committer — what does it change? What it means to join the Apache community, what the impact of professional Open Source is, and more.

			<string>The advantages of Grails</string>
			<key>sessionDescription</key>
			<string>In this presentation I will show some of the advantages of using the Grails framework.
Grails is a web-framework built on the “shoulders of giants”. It acts as an easy, yet very powerful layer on top of Spring MVC, Hibernate and Sitemesh. It aims at developer speed by applying “convention over configuration”, sensible defaults and easy access to common functionality. It integrates easily with application containers (like Tomcat) on the JVM. Grails has a lively plugin community, where a wide variety of common functionality is captured.

			<string>Geb for Browser Automation</string>
			<key>sessionDescription</key>
			<string>In this session, we will see how Geb can be used to automate the testing of your entire application by automating browser testing.
Geb is build on top of Selenium WebDriver, but it brings together the power of WebDriver, the elegance of jQuery content selection,
a robust page object modelling while using the expressiveness of Groovy and the power of Spock.
We will se how to structure the tests to make them easy to maintain, and how we can interact with both the browser and an underlying Grails application (if needed).
Finally, We will see how it is possible to interact with javascript on the webpage under test, and examples on what browser automation also can be used for.

Sshoogr started as a simple SSH wrapper, but currently it is growing to become Ansible of Groovy. That allows to combine configuration, connectivity and state management of your servers and containers within a simple and readable DSL.

			<string>Groovy is a compiled language for the JVM with a number of fascinating features: a language which is both dynamic and static, strongly or weakly typed, functional and imperative, supporting a modern type inference, DSLs, … How does that all come together? How, from a source file, do you end up with classes compiled and loaded at runtime? If terms like parsing, abstract syntax tree, type checking, type inference, bytecode or even verifier puzzle you, then this talk is made for you!

			<string>Creating and Testing Rest Contracts with Accurest Gradle Plugin</string>
			<key>sessionDescription</key>
			<string>REST does not come with an in-built contract compliance mechanism, which in many ways is a great thing (no cumbersome xml schemas). However, while working with microservice-based systems, it often appears that a practical mechanism that would provide help in shaping and describing REST contracts would come in handy.
Similarly, creating integration and acceptance tests in such systems presents many challenges. On one hand, we want to make the development and deployment of each service independent and agile, so we tend to use stubs, on the other hand, if we are not able to carry out proper E2E tests, we want to make sure that at any point in time, our stubs are in keeping with how are server actually responds to any given request.
In this talk, I will present Accurest, a Gradle plugin that allows for both: easily shaping REST contracts and verifying if our app adheres to them using automatically generated Spock tests. I will show how, using Accurest, we can quickly generate automatically-tested stubs from simple Groovy DSL scripts. I will talk about the typical usages and script examples, as well as possible problems and ways of handling them.

			<string>Continuous Delivery as Code with Jenkins and Gradle</string>
			<key>sessionDescription</key>
			<string>Continuous Delivery enables building, testing and deploying of software through build pipelines faster and more frequently with a well known steps.
But how to implement a continuous delivery pipeline in real world? How to translate the theory into practice?
In this session we are going to discuss how Jenkins and Gradle can help you on build this pipeline/workflow and the advantages of implementing this pipeline as code instead of using Jenkins static build steps.
We will start by a really simple Java EE application and learn how to build it with Gradle, automating unit, integration and functional tests, incorporating popular code quality tools, as well as packaging, publishing and deploying the deliverable using Jenkins Workflow as the director of the whole process.

			<string>Reactive Streams and the wide world of Groovy</string>
			<key>sessionDescription</key>
			<string>The concept of Reactive Streams (aka Reactive Extensions, Reactive Functional Programming, or simply Rx) has become increasingly popular recently, and with good reason. The Reactive Streams specification provides a universal abstraction for asynchronously processing data received across multiple sources (e.g. database, user input, third-party services), and includes mechanisms for controlling the rate at which data is received. This makes it a powerful tool within a Microservice platform. And did we mention that the Groovy lang community is quite involved?
In this talk we’ll explore the various features and concepts of Reactive Streams. We’ll talk about some typical use cases for Rx and more importantly, how to implement them. We’ll focus primarily on RxGroovy and Ratpack, then provide example implementations that show you how to get started with this powerful technique.

			<string>Operating Microservices with Groovy</string>
			<key>sessionDescription</key>
			<string>When you are developing a microservices arquitecture, you often have to call some of them, for manual testing, scripting and/or operations. Given the dynamic nature of Groovy, could it be used to make easier these calls?
* Could we call our services with a syntax shorter and more natural, instead of using long curls, but not losing the history capability of a shell?
* Could we query the documentation of the operations in the same way?
* Could we even have autocomplete features of our service operations, so that we don’t have to remember their names?
* Could we do all this dynamically, without having to create a specific client for each service, but calling it as if it were?
* Could we have a directory of available services, so that we don’t have to remember them?
* Could this directory and the utility classes be updated automatically for all the team when someone makes a change, using a Git repository?
You are invited to a journey through the mud, exploring features such as Groovy metaclasses, class loading, REST services, shell capabilities and AST transformations, and making some dark tricks to achieve what we want.

			<string>Fluent SQL with JOOQ</string>
			<key>sessionDescription</key>
			<string>Hibernate and other ORMs try to get developers to forget that SQL exists. Then you deal with Lazy Initialization Exceptions or “simple” queries running dozens of queries behind the scenes. JOOQ is a typesafe, fluent API for building sql queries directly in your code without resorting to string concatenation.
JOOQ provides several features to make writing SQL less painful including POJO data binding, code generation for models and the active record pattern to skip writing simple CRUD sql. Additionally there are features that missing or difficult in ORMs like stored procedure support, mutli tenancy and hooks into the query lifecycle.
Embrace SQL and leave your ORM behind.

			<string>Groovy is awesome – that’s a fact. But did you know that Spring Cloud’s awesome too? If you’re going the microservice direction (and who isn’t today right?) then Spring Cloud gives you the toolset!
Service Discovery and Registry (Zookeeper / Consul / Eureka), easy request sending with client side load balancing (Feign + Ribbon), request proxying with Zuul. A lot of people already know these features but not that many know about Spring Cloud Sleuth (the distributed tracing solution for your cloud) and Spring Cloud Stream (messaging between microservices has never been that easy!).
In this presentation we’ll see a Groovy microserviced based system using the Spring Cloud tooling. We’ll focus on distributed tracing with Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin.

#fame is the India’s first mobile only Live streaming mobile platform. Where you can be both audience as well as performer. With a click on the app one can GO LIVE and show their talent to the world. The application is backed by the Micro service based architecture using Grails.
So I am gonna talk about the how we architect the live streaming platform and how quickly we went bigger in terms of user base &#038; Traffic. What proactive measures were taken to make the application scalable.
Till Date(13th Oct 2015) we have more than 11 Lakhs installs, 3 Lakh+ Registered users and still counting <img src="http://greach.botconf.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
Areas covered during the talk:
What is Live stream?
Some video domain terminology like RTSP, HLS, DVR, Player, Transcoding, Adaptive bitrate etc
Architecture of the application
Challenges faced while scaling the application
Load stats and success stories
How we used prediction.io for generating recommendations : Recommendation system on Grails

			<key>sessionDescription</key>
			<string>AsciidoctorJ is the official library to run Asciidoctor on the JVM. It is used to convert AsciiDoc files to HTML, PDF or DocBook documents. AsciidoctorJ offers a simple extension mechanism which allows to add new features and capabilities to the conversion process.
One such extension is the AsciidocJ screenshot plugin. It makes use of GEB to create screenshots of a web browser and adds them directly to the generated document. Automating the process of taking screenshots is yet another step towards a living documentation. And also one thing less to remember when doing a release.
This session gives an introduction to the AsciidoctorJ extension mechanism and the power which can be unleashed when it is combined with Groovy. The screenshot extension is used to show, not just how simple it is to create an extension, but also why Groovy is the perfect tool for this job. Because nothing speaks as clearly as code, a basic version of the screenshot extension will be created live on stage. Showing both the simplicity and the power which Groovy offers as the extension language of choice.

			<string>I’ve become interested in Groovy while working in Berlin in spring 2010. I liked it so much that I decided to shift my career towards web development with Grails. I’m really happy to have made that decision back then as Groovy ecosystem is not only full of good projects but it’s also full of friendly and outstanding developers. That’s why I like going to conferences focused on Groovy and sometimes even become a speaker at them.
I believe in Open Source Software and have a strong need to give back to the community whenever possible especially as I make a living using Grails which is an open source project. That’s why I’m proud to be one of the core commiters of Geb. I’ve also managed to get few pull requests accepted into many Groovy ecosystem projects like Grails, Gaelyk and Codenarc to name a few.
I’ve worked in four different countries (Poland, Germany, The Netherlands, United Kingdom) with different technologies and languages (from Java through Javascript, Python and Ruby to Groovy) and developed my skills over the years. I believe that software should not only work, but also has to be ‘beautiful under the hood’, maintainable, well-tested and the source code should be clean and consistent. And I can’t imagine coding without doing TDD anymore…
